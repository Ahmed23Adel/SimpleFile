# SimpleFile(Under development)
Simple interface, for all important methods it might be needed when dealing with a any text file, I wanted to ecapsulate all boilerplate code for any basic tasks, like:

1. read_frist_xxx: xxx could be char, word, sentence, paragraph
2. read_frist_n_xxx: xxx could be char, word, sentence, paragraph
3. read_xxx_at: xxx could be char, word, sentence, or paragraph
4. read_next_xxx: xxx could be char, word, sentence, or paragraph
5. replace_xxx_at: xxx could be char, word, sentence, or paragraph
6. append_at
7. delete_at
8. applay_on_xxx: xxx could be char, word, sentence, or paragraph
9. find
10. get_one_hot_encoding_chars

**There are mulitple reading types, like view or edit**

it's intended to be very basic simple library for any text-file project

# Languages, and design patterns
